Genetic algorithms, genetic programming, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, learning classifier systems, co-evolutionary approaches, and estimation of distribution algorithms are the techniques considered. The novelty of our approach comes in three different manners: it covers time lapses not included in other review articles, it covers problems not considered by others, and the scope covered by past and new references is compared and analyzed. The results concluded the interest about methods and problems has changed through time. Although, genetic algorithms have remained the most popular approach in the literature. There are combinations of problems and solutions methods which are yet to be investigated.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Robust Genetic Programming approach for discovering profitable trading rules which are used to manage a portfolio of stocks from the Spanish market. The investigated method is used to determine potential buy and sell conditions for stocks, aiming to yield robust solutions able to withstand extreme market conditions, while producing high returns at a minimal risk. One of the biggest challenges GP evolved solutions face is over-fitting. GP trading rules need to have similar performance when tested with new data in order to be deployed in a real situation. We explore a random sampling method (RSFGP) which instead of calculating the fitness over the whole dataset, calculates it on randomly selected segments. This method shows improved robustness and out-of-sample results compared to standard genetic programming (SGP) and a volatility adjusted fitness (VAFGP). Trading strategies (TS) are evolved using financial metrics like the volatility, CAPM alpha and beta, and the Sharpe ratio alongside other Technical Indicators (TI) to find the best investment strategy. These strategies are evaluated using 21 of the most liquid stocks of the Spanish market. The achieved results clearly outperform Buy{\&}Hold, SGP and VAFGP. Additionally, the solutions obtained with the training data during the experiments clearly show during testing robustness to step market declines as seen during the European sovereign debt crisis experienced recently in Spain. In this paper the solutions learned were able to operate for prolonged periods, which demonstrated the validity and robustness of the rules learned, which are able to operate continuously and with minimal human intervention. To sum up, the developed method is able to evolve TSs suitable for all market conditions with promising results, which suggests great potential in the method generalization capabilities. The use of financial metrics alongside popular TI enables the system to increase the stock return while proving resilient through time. The RSFGP system is able to cope with different types of markets achieving a portfolio return of 31.81{\%} for the testing period 2009-2013 in the Spanish market, having the IBEX35 index returned 2.67{\%}.},

This rule defines when to buy or sell, the profit pursued in each operation, and the maximum bearable loss. In order to untie the results from randomness, we used a database comprised of 91,307 intraday observations from the US Dow Jones index. We parameterized the trading rule by generating 96 different configurations and reported the results of the whole sample over 3 subperiods. In order to widen its validity we also replicated the analysis on two leading European indexes: the German DAX and the British FTSE. The returns provided by the proposed trading rule are higher for the European than for the US index, which highlights the greater inefficiency of the European markets.},

abstract = {In trading in currency markets, reducing the mean of absolute or squared errors of predicted values is not valuable unless it results in profits. A trading rule is a set of conditions that describe when to buy or sell a currency or to close a position, which can be used for automated trading. To optimize the rule to obtain a profit in the future, a probabilistic method such as a genetic algorithm (GA) or genetic programming (GP) is utilized, since the profit is a discrete and multimodal function with many parameters. Although the rules optimized by GA/GP reportedly obtain a profit in out-of-sample testing periods, it is hard to believe that they yield a profit in distant out-of-sample periods. In this paper, we first consider a framework where we optimize the parameters of the trading rule in an in-sample training period, and then execute trades according to the rule in its succeeding out-of-sample period. We experimentally show that the framework very often results in a profit. We then consider a framework in which we conduct optimization as above and then execute trades in distant out-of-sample periods. We empirically show that the results depend on the similarity of the trends in the training and testing periods. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The approach is also especially efficient running in a multiple processor, multiple selection-strategy mode using multiple settings.

This approach raises the risk of data snooping, since so many proxies are proposed. We review and examine the profitability of a wide range of 93 market indicators.

abstract = {Technical and quantitative analysis in financial trading use mathematical and statistical tools to help investors decide on the optimum moment to initiate and close orders. While these traditional approaches have served their purpose to some extent, new techniques arising from the field of computational intelligence such as machine learning and data mining have emerged to analyse financial information. While the main financial engineering research has focused on complex computational models such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, there are also simpler models that have demonstrated their usefulness in applications other than financial trading, and are worth considering to determine their advantages and inherent limitations when used as trading analysis tools. This paper analyses the role of simple machine learning models to achieve profitable trading through a series of trading simulations in the FOREX market. It assesses the performance of the models and how particular setups of the models produce systematic and consistent predictions for profitable trading. Due to the inherent complexities of financial time series the role of attribute selection, periodic retraining and training set size are discussed in order to obtain a combination of those parameters not only capable of generating positive cumulative returns for each one of the machine learning models but also to demonstrate how simple algorithms traditionally precluded from financial forecasting for trading applications presents similar performances as their more complex counterparts. The paper discusses how a combination of attributes in addition to technical indicators that has been used as inputs of the machine learning-based predictors such as price related features, seasonality features and lagged values used in classical time series analysis are used to enhance the classification capabilities that impacts directly into the final profitability.},

abstract = {Evolutionary learning is one of the most popular techniques for designing quantitative investment (QI) products. Trend following (TF) strategies, owing to their briefness and efficiency, are widely accepted by investors. Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, no related research has investigated TF investment strategies within an evolutionary learning model. This paper proposes a hybrid long-term and short-term evolutionary trend following algorithm (eTrend) that combines TF investment strategies with the eXtended Classifier Systems (XCS). The proposed eTrend algorithm has two advantages: (1) the combination of stock investment strategies (i.e., TF) and evolutionary learning (i.e., XCS) can significantly improve computation effectiveness and model practicability, and (2) XCS can automatically adapt to market directions and uncover reasonable and understandable trading rules for further analysis, which can help avoid the irrational trading behaviors of common investors. To evaluate eTrend, experiments are carried out using the daily trading data stream of three famous indexes in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Experimental results indicate that eTrend outperforms the buy-and-hold strategy with high Sortino ratio after the transaction cost. Its performance is also superior to the decision tree and artificial neural network trading models. Furthermore, as the concept drift phenomenon is common in the stock market, an exploratory concept drift analysis is conducted on the trading rules discovered in bear and bull market phases. The analysis revealed interesting and rational results. In conclusion, this paper presents convincing evidence that the proposed hybrid trend following model can indeed generate effective trading guidance for investors. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, this paper aims to provide the first systematic literature review on the state-of-the-art application of EC techniques for rule discovery in stock AT. Out of 650 articles published before 2013 (inclusive), 51 relevant articles from 24 journals were confirmed. These papers were reviewed and grouped into three analytical method categories (fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and blending analysis) and three EC technique categories (evolutionary algorithm, swarm intelligence, and hybrid EC techniques). A significant bias toward the applications of genetic algorithm-based (GA) and genetic programming-based (GP) techniques in technical trading rule discovery is observed. Other EC techniques and fundamental analysis lack sufficient study. Furthermore, we summarize the information on the evaluation scheme of selected papers and particularly analyze the researches which compare their models with buy and hold strategy (B{\&}H). We observe an interesting phenomenon where most of the existing techniques perform effectively in the downtrend and poorly in the uptrend, and considering the distribution of research in the classification framework, we suggest that this phenomenon can be attributed to the inclination of factor selections and problem in transaction cost selections. We also observe the significant influence of the transaction cost change on the margins of excess return. Other influenced factors are also presented in detail. The absence of ways for market trend prediction and the selection of transaction cost are two major limitations of the studies reviewed. In addition, the combination of trading rule discovery techniques and portfolio selection is a major research gap. Our review reveals the research focus and gaps in applying EC techniques for rule discovery in stock AT and suggests a roadmap for future research.},

That is why a number of researchers have turned their full attention to the different aspects of this problem lately. However, there is no well-rounded theoretical and technical framework for approaching the problem to the best of our knowledge. We believe the existing lack of such clarity on the topic is due to its interdisciplinary nature that involves at its core both behavioral-economic topics as well as artificial intelligence. We dive deeper into the interdisciplinary nature and contribute to the formation of a clear frame of discussion. We review the related works that are about market prediction based on online-text-mining and produce a picture of the generic components that they all have. We, furthermore, compare each system with the rest and identify their main differentiating factors. Our comparative analysis of the systems expands onto the theoretical and technical foundations behind each. This work should help the research community to structure this emerging field and identify the exact aspects which require further research and are of special significance. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This research paper focuses on studying the impact of Currency Pairs, Time Frames and Technical Indicators on Trading Profit in Foreign Exchange Spot Market. The study also is aimed at exploring the relationship between various related parameters such as Profitability, Maximum Draw Down, Time in Position, Dealt Lots and Charges associated with currency trading. The period of study is from 01.09.2006 to 10.06.2008 and the data collected with a sample size of 1400, pertains to two trade durations viz. i) one year and ii) three months. The study covers four popular Currency Pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF {\&} USD/JPY), six Time Frames (5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours {\&} 1 day) and ten Indicators (5 leading and 5 lagging). The study very clearly shows that Technical Analysis is profitable in currency trading, and this is proved by the fact that all the Currency Pairs, Time Frames and Indicators have yielded trading profits in Forex Spot Market. Among the four currency pairs, EUR/USD proves to be more profitable, strong and less risky. Though there is no notable difference in trading profit, while using different Time Frames, it is observed that trading with shorter time frames are more risky and provide low liquidity to the traders, as compared to longer Time Frames. Regarding use of Indicators, if used scientifically with combinations of proper strategies, they produce significant profits. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {In this paper, a genetic algorithm will be described that aims at optimizing a set of rules that constitute a trading system for the Forex market. Each individual in the population represents a set of ten technical trading rules (five to enter a position and five others to exit). These rules have 31 parameters in total, which correspond to the individuals' genes. The population will evolve in a given environment, defined by a time series of a specific currency pair. The fitness of a given individual represents how well it has been able to adapt to the environment, and it is calculated by applying the corresponding rules to the time series, and then calculating the ratio between the profit and the maximum drawdown (the Stirling ratio). Two currency pairs have been used: EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Different data was used for the evolution of the population and for testing the best individuals. The results achieved by the system are discussed. The best individuals are able to achieve very good results in the training series. In the test series, the developed strategies show some difficulty in achieving positive results, if you take transaction costs into account. If you ignore transaction costs, the results are mostly positive, showing that the best individuals have some forecasting ability. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Dynamic portfolio trading system is used to allocate one's capital to a number of securities through time in a way to maximize the portfolio return and to minimize the portfolio risk. Genetic programming (GP) as an artificial intelligence technique has been used successfully in the financial field, especially for the forecasting tasks in the financial markets. In this paper, GP is used to develop a dynamic portfolio trading system to capture dynamics of stock market prices through time. The proposed approach takes an integrated view on multiple stocks when the GP evolves and generates a rule base for dynamic portfolio trading based on the technical indices. In the present research, a multitree GP forest has been developed to extend the GP structure to extract multiple trading rules from historical data. Furthermore, the consequent part of each trading rule includes a function rather than a constant value. Besides, the transaction cost of trading which plays an important role in the profitability of a dynamic portfolio trading system is taken into account. This model was used to develop dynamic portfolio trading systems. The profitability of the model was examined for both the emerging and the mature markets. The numerical results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms other traditional models of dynamic and static portfolio selection in terms of the portfolio return and risk adjusted return. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, focused on the application of a GA to the tuning of technical trading rules in the context of financial markets, our tentative thesis is that the GA is robust with respect to design changes. The optimization of technical trading systems is a suitable area for the application of the GA metaheuristic, as the complexity of the problem grows exponentially as new technical rules are added to the system and as the answer time is crucial when applying the system to real-time data. Up to now, most of GAs applications to this subject obviated the question of possible “design dependence” in their results. The data we report, based on our experiments, do not allow us to refute the hypothesis of robustness of the GA to design implementation, when applying to technical trading systems tuning.},

Accuracy of each of the prediction models for each of the two input approaches is evaluated.

@article{Wang2014,
abstract = {Technical trading rules have been utilized in the stock market to make profit for more than a century. However, only using a single trading rule may not be sufficient to predict the stock price trend accurately. Although some complex trading strategies combining various classes of trading rules have been proposed in the literature, they often pick only one rule for each class, which may lose valuable information from other rules in the same class. In this paper, a complex stock trading strategy, namely performance-based reward strategy (PRS), is proposed. PRS combines the two most popular classes of technical trading rules - moving average (MA) and trading range break-out (TRB). For both MA and TRB, PRS includes various combinations of the rule parameters to produce a universe of 140 component trading rules in all. Each component rule is assigned a starting weight, and a reward/penalty mechanism based on rules' recent profit is proposed to update their weights over time. To determine the best parameter values of PRS, we employ an improved time variant particle swarm optimization (TVPSO) algorithm with the objective of maximizing the annual net profit generated by PRS. The experiments show that PRS outperforms all of the component rules in the testing period. To assess the significance of our trading results, we apply bootstrapping methodology to test three popular null models of stock return: the random walk, the AR(1) and the GARCH(1, 1). The results show that PRS is not consistent with these null models and has good predictive ability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we will focus on the MACD indicator for four currencies namely EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF and USDJPY individually to identify effectiveness of the indicator regarding to the amount of profit generated, using hourly data of market stretch from January 2001 to December 2010. Virtual Historical Trading Software (VHTS) is developed for the purpose of computing the indicator based on its original formulas and interpretations; for applying the assumptions; for trading based on buy and sell signals},

abstract = {Traders and economists are often at odds with regards to the ap- proach taken towards Forex financial market forecasting. Methods originating from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) area of study have been used extensively throughout the years in predicting the trading pattern as it is deemed to be ro- bust enough to handle the uncertainty associated with Forex trading time series data. Herein this paper, the effects of different input types, in particular: close price as well as various technical indicators derived from the close price are in- vestigated to determine its effects on the Forex trend predicted by an intelligent machine learning module.},

abstract = {Quantitative investment (QI) is certainly a hot topic in big data analysis. For knowledge discovery in huge, complex and nonlinear stock market data, the eXtended Classifier Systems (XCS) is quite suitable because of the excellent learning and explicit expression abilities derived from its intrinsic techniques that include classification rule mining, evolutionary learning and reinforcement learning. This paper presents an Evolutionary Trend Reversion Model (eTrendRev), which is based on the proposed XCS with learn mode (XCSL) and trend-reversion strategy. The eTrendRev is highlighted in three aspects: (1) the explicit rules generated by XCSL are more understandable than black-box models, such as neural networks, thus can provide justifiable knowledge to guide trading; (2) the original pure explore mode of XCS is substituted by the proposed learn mode, which is shown in this study to perform better and is more stable; (3) a variety of trend-reversion strategies are integrated and made dynamic through evolutionary learning. For model evaluation, experiments were carried out on the historical data of the Shanghai Composite Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index, and back-testing results indicate that eTrendRev can produce higher return with lower risk and recognize significant market turning points in a timely fashion. This study also confirms the profitability of using sole trend-reversion indicators in machine learning-based QI model. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},
